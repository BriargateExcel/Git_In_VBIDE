# Overview #
This repo creates the capability to manipulate Git and GitHub from within the VBIDE.
## Usage ##
From within the GitRoutines module, execute the CreateMenu sub. This adds a new dropdown menu in the main VBIDE menu called GitCommands.
From the GitCommands menu, select Export VBA Project to export any active VBA Project to any directory.
##Limitations##
As of this initial commit, only the capability to export and import VBA Projects is available. The plan is to augment these options.
